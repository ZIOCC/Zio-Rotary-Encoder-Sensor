# Zio-Rotary-Encoder-Sensor
Zio Rotary Encoder Sensor

Description:

This is a U-Shaped infrared sensor that can be used to detect the rotational speed of a motor mounted on a robot. This reading can be used to adjust the motor speed if it is too fast or too slow, and to calculate the robot’s real-world travel speed. Using a pair of these sensors, we can also measure the robot’s rotation, enabling navigation based on dead-reckoning methods.


Specifications:

U-Shaped Sensor Gap: 5mm
Output Signal Explaination: when the IR beam is unobstructed (not blocked by the encoder disc) it outputs a logic-LOW level(0); when blocked it outputs HIGH Level(1).
IR Signal Trigger: SN74LVC1G14 Single Schmitt-Trigger Inverter.
Dimension: 32x 14mm.
Weight: 1.9g.
