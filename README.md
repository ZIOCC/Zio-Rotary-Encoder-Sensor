#### Description

This is a U-Shaped infrared sensor that can be used to detect the rotational speed of a motor mounted on a robot. This reading can be used to adjust the motor speed if it is too fast or too slow, and to calculate the robot’s real-world travel speed. Using a pair of these sensors, we can also measure the robot’s rotation, enabling navigation based on dead-reckoning methods.




#### Specification

* U-Shaped Sensor Gap: 5mm
* Output Signal Explaination: when the IR beam is unobstructed (not blocked by the encoder disc) it outputs a logic-LOW level(0); when blocked it outputs HIGH Level(1).
* IR Signal Trigger: SN74LVC1G14 Single Schmitt-Trigger Inverter
* Dimension: 32x 14mm
* Weight: 1.9g
